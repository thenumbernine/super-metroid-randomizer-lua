Super Metroid item randomizer
Based on https://github.com/Dessyreqt/smrandomizer
But spun off to add a lot more features.

Depends on LuaJIT

Item spawn choices are based on enter and exit dependencies.

Possible routes those that don't always start out going back up through the old mother brain room and Crateria

Added randomization of item drops and monster weaknesses
