Super Metroid item randomizer

Depends on LuaJIT

randomizes the following:
- item placement
- enemy item drops 
- enemy health
- enemy touch damage
- enemy shot damage
- enemy weaknesses

The item placement algorithm does a depth-first search to make sure that there is at least one possible run that will result in the game being won.

This doesn't mean that you can't get permanently stuck in a room.  It just means that somewhere you can access the item that you need to get unstuck.  So save often.
